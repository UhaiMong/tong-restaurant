        <p class="about">The exterior of the restaurant, a captivating blend of modern concrete and time-worn brick
            walls, stands as a
            visual
            metaphor for the fusion of eras. Itâ€™s a living embodiment of the history that has unfolded within its walls.
            As you
            enter, the exposed ceiling serves as a gateway to the past, a silent witness to the passage of time. The
            walls adorned
            with Shou-shugi ban burnt wood tell a fiery tale, adding to the mystique that envelops Tong Restaurant.</p>
